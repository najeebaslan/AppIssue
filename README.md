## Installation
1 Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/najeebaslan/AppIssue.git
```
## Prerequisites
🕒 Setup Work Manager
- ⇢  Setup with (IOS OS):
- 1- Go to file ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift and add ```import workmanager```.
- 2- Add this code  
``` 
Bool{
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self
WorkmanagerPlugin.setPluginRegistrantCallback {
 registry in GeneratedPluginRegistrant.register(with: registry)
} }
```
- 3- Add outside the ```Bool{}``` breakpoint this code for show notification in foreground
```
override func userNotificationCenter(
_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter,
willPresent notification: UNNotification,
withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationPresentationOptions) -> Void) {
completionHandler(.alert) // shows banner even if app is in foreground
}
```

For more information open this link
[here](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_workmanager/blob/main/IOS_SETUP.md)

- 4- Add this code in ios/Runner/Info.plist
``` 
<key>UIBackgroundModes</key>
<array>
<string>fetch</string>
<string>processing</string>
</array>
<!-- If you want know why do this look the link https://poe.com/s/oMOikdWDl6F5svpSgdzg -->
<key>BGTaskSchedulerPermittedIdentifiers</key>
<array>
<string>task-identifier</string>
<string>com.example.issues_new_version0</string><!-- First task at 8:00 AM -->
<string>com.example.issues_new_version1<!-- Second task at 8:00 PM -->
</array>
```
* Note==> Replace [```com.example.issues_new_version0``` and ```com.example.issues_new_version1```] by your task identifier 

- 5- Add file sound like this:- ```ios/notification_sound.wav```

* Note:- now you are ready for test task with ```Iphone```.
  But if you using ios simulator should by do some steps below
- Open ios folder with `XCode` and then open ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift
- Click breakpoint on ```override func application```
- Run project and the it's when the `XCode` will stop in your breakpoint 
- open terminal form `XCode` it's found it in the bottom screen
- Paste this code and click enter
```
e -l objc -- (void)[[BGTaskScheduler sharedScheduler] _simulateLaunchForTaskWithIdentifier:@"com.example.issues_new_version0"]
```
- Click button `Debug` and selected `Simulate Background Fetch` 
- Then pressed icon ▶️ from `terminal` 
### ⚠️ Important Notes
* replace ``com.example.issues_new_version0`` by your task identifier
